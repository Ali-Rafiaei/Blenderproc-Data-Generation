# Install
1. clone the repo
2. create a new Python environment and install Blenderproc using pip
3. run the code from the cloned repo based on the usage (one object or the bin) with the below command:<br>
   'blenderproc run [script-name].py'
   
**Note:** First time you run a blenderproc script, blenderproc will check if blender exists and downloads it in case of not existing.
